# Shader Playground

Basic template with a box, plane, and sphere set up using THREE.js and dat.gui.
Each shape in the /objects folder is importing a vertex and fragment shader from the /shaders folder. Just change the import to apply a different shader to it.

This file will hopefully be updated to become a full step-by-step guide on how to apply and manipulate shaders using a very basic THREE.js scene.
